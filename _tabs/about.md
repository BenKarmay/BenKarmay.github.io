Compiling small chunks of knowledge into a practical and logical article is a great motivator for engaging in technical documentation. Usable technical documentation is something I need and want to create more of as part of an ongoing learning process in Cyber and Information Security. 

Acknowledging that everything I learn and benefit from, required great enthusiasm, generosity, care, and persistence to impart; It seems natural to attempt to further that pursuit by contributing back in a small way and also promote awareness of the incredible work going on in the community. From what often looks clinical and dull from the outside I think this can add an engaging emotional element.
