Compiling small chunks of knowledge into a practical and logical article is an organic motivator for engaging in technical documentation. Usable technical documentation is something I need and want to create as part of my continuous learning in Cyber and Information Security. Sharing is caring isn't it and few things are more rewarding than imbuing knowledge and choice and control in others. I think this can add an engaging emotional element to what often looks clinical and dull from the outside.

Acknowledging that everything I learn and benefit from, required great enthusiasm, generosity, care, and persistence to impart; It seems natural to attempt to further that pursuit by contributing back in a small way and also promote awareness of the incredible work going on in the community.
